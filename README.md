Burning Al Token (BAIT)
Whitepaper

June 2025
Executive Summary
Burning Al Token (BAIT) represents a groundbreaking fusion of deflationary tokenomics and artificial intelligence utility
on the Binance Smart Chain. With an
immediate 90% token burn and 1.5% annual
deflation mechanism, BAIT is engineered to become progressively scarcer while powering an expanding Al ecosystem.

1. Project Vision
1.1 The BAIT Advantage
Radical Scarcity Model: 90% of supply burned at launch, with continuous annual
burns
Al-Powered Utility. Native integration with BAIT Al Assistant and future Al tools
Sustainable Economy: 0.2% transaction tax supporting liquidity and development

1.2 Market Opportunity
The global Al crypto market is projected to reach $108 by 2027. BAIT captures this growth through:

Al chatbot for crypto analytics Planned Al trading signal generation NFT-based Al assistant customization

2. Technical Implementation

2.1 Smart Contract Architecture
Security:
Audited by CertiK (simulated)
Multi-sig treasury wallet
Team tokens vested over 24 months

2.2 Al Integration Roadmap

3. Advanced Tokenomics

3.1 Supply Dynamics
Figure 1: Projected token supply over 10 years
3.2 Transaction Tax Breakdown
3.3 Liquidity Management
Initial LP locked for 2 years via PinkSale Continuous LP feeding from transaction
taxes Quarterly liquidity audits
4. Expansion Strategy

4.1 Exchange Listings
Phase 1 (2025):
PancakeSwap (Completed)
BKEX
BitMart
Phase 2 (2026):
Gate.io
MEXC
KuCoin
4.2 Partnership Pipeline

5. Governance & DAO
02 2026 Transition to Full DAO:
BAIT holders vote on:
Burn rate adjustments
Treasury allocations
Partnership approvals
Voting weight proportional to tokens held Minimum 1M BAIT to propose governance changes

6. Risk Assessment
6.1 Identified Risks
1. Al Model Failure
Mitigation: Hybrid on/off-chain Al
architecture

2. Regulatory Challenges
Mitigation: No US marketing, focus on
global DeFi markets

3. Market Volatility Mitigation: Deflationary design counters
sell pressure

6.2 Contingency Plans
Emergency burn functions (community
activated)
Treasury-backed price stabilization fund Multi-chain expansion (Ethereum, Polygon)

7. Financial Projections

7.1 Burn Rate Economics
BAIT Tokenomics: Annual Burn
Mechanism

1. Annual Burn Mechanics
Burn Rate: 1.5% of remaining supply
each year
Final Supply: Stops when reaching
10M BAIT (from initial 100M)
Effect: Supply decreases Scarcity Increases Upward price pressure

2. Price Impact Calculation
Year 1 Example (Starting at
$0.01/BAIT):
Pre-Burn Supply: 100M BAIT
Tokens Burned:
100,000,000 1.5% 1,500,000
BAIT
New Supply:
100,000,000 1,500,000 =
98,500,000 BAIT
Price Impact (assuming demand
stays constant):
New Price (Original Price
Original Supply)/ New Supply
(50.01 100M)/ 98.5M
$0.01015
(+1.52% price increase)
Year 2 (Compounding Effect):
New Supply: 98.5M BAIT
Tokens Burned:
98,500,000 1,5% 1,477,500

BAIT
New Price:
(10.0101598.5%) / 97,022,500
$0.01030
(+1.5% from Year 1, +3.04% total)

3. Long-Term Projection
Key Insight: After 45 years, supply
reaches 10M BAIT, and price could
10x (assuming constant demand).
Faster burns (from buys/sells) would
accelerate this.

4. Real-World Factors
Demand Fluctuations: Actual price
depends on trading activity
Liquidity Pool Dynamics: Burns
reduce supply, but buys/sells impact
price short-term
Team Wallet Fees: 0.2% fees slightly
reduce circulating supply,
compounding scarcity

5. Formula Summary
Annual Price Increase
(Burn
Rate) (1 Burn Rate) 1.5%/
98.5% 1.52%
For small burn rates, price rises-equal
to the burn rate annually.

7. Growth Metrics
Target 50,000 holders by EOY 2025
SSM market cap milestone within 12
months
Al product adoption goal: 10,000 MAU by Q2
2026
